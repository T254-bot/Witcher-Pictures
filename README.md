# Site Overview 
Witcher Pictures is a site dedicated to showcasing photography from the award winning video game Witcher 3 the Wild Hunt. The Witcher is an immensly popular franchise wether it be fans of the books, games or more recently from the Netflix series. There are many fans like myself who have sunk dozens of hours into this game and still to this day find things they have never seen before, or are simply blown away by the attention to detail and high quality textures used throughout the landscapes and interiors of the open world. Yet despite that I rarley come across any images that really capture the beauty of this game, sure there are some out there, but what I have found tends to be alot of the same images, with any being unique or actually from the within game being few and far between. This site looks to change that by hosting a large number of images all in one, easy to navigate site, where users are able to look through and download any they like and use them themselves with just a few taps of their screen.
