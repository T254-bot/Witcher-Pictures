# Site Overview 
Witcher Pictures is a site dedicated to showcasing photography from the award winning video game Witcher 3 the Wild Hunt. The Witcher is an immensely popular franchise wether it be fans of the books, games or more recently from the Netflix series. There are many fans like myself who have sunk dozens of hours into this game and still to this day find things they have never seen before, or are simply blown away by the attention to detail and high quality textures used throughout the landscapes and interiors of the open world. Yet despite that I rarely come across any images that really capture the beauty of this game, sure there are some out there, but what I have found tends to be a lot of the same images, with any being unique or actually from the within game being few and far between. This site looks to change that by hosting a large number of images all in one, easy to navigate site, where users are able to look through and download any they like and use them themselves with just a few taps of their screen.

# Planning 

## Target Audiences:
* Users who are dedicated fans of the franchise and game looking for unique, visually appealing backgrounds of landscapes and set pieces they will recognize, taken within the game.
* Users who have some knowledge of the franchise and are interested about the game.
* Users who have little to no knowledge about the franchise or video games in general and are interested in learning about it aswell as seeing how visually impressive a video game can be.
## User Stories:


## Color Scheme:

When choosing the colors for my site, I wanted a darker color for my main background color to contrast nicely against my images, the majority of which are bright and colorful. So I went with the dark grey as the main background color, with some slightly lighter and darker greys as secondary background colors (for things such as the modal and modal close button). Not only did it achieve the effect i wanted with the majorly of bright images, but also didn't blend in with the darker images and still gave a notable contrast between the image and the backdrop. I wanted to incorporate the bright crimson color mostly as a stylistic choice as a similar bright red contrasting with dark grey scheme is found within many of the games menu's aswell as the title itself. I then went for a slightly off white color for the text as I knew the color would contrast nicely on the greys and red for readability, while not being to bright against the dark grey.

Below is a grid that I have used to check the contrast scores so as to be sure all text remains readable throughout the site, created on https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ .

## Wireframes:

Here are my wireframes that I created at the start of my project and used as the rough template for my site, for mobile, tablet and desktop viewing. Below them you will find a list detailing how the design has changed as the development process was going on. More information on why these changes where made will be found in ******* section of this file.


* The first big difference between the wireframe and finished product is the carousel on the home page, which i initially planned on being a row of several images that all slide to the left in synch with one another and reacted responsively (two images of mobile and tablet, three on desktop).

* The second change being made to the about page which I decided to reformat slightly so as to not be almost identical to the home page of the site. I decided to add another image in to both add more content to the page and assist in achieving a more noticeably responsive design, aswell as breaking text up more evenly so as to not bombard the user with one massive paragraph of text.

* The final big change I would like to point out is the columns of images on the gallery page on tablet was initially going to be two, the same as mobile just with more spacing between the images. the reason I changed this to three columns was partly to show more noticeable responsiveness along with the fact I liked it more than my original design once I had done it, however it was mostly because I found I would need either a visually unappealing amount of spacing between images or have the images be larger to fill in the spaces which caused issues with the image dimensions on the right hand side.

* Finally I would just like to mention a few small differences. That positioning of the nav toggle icon changed simply because I struggled to move it to the right hand side of the display, and when looking and testing it myself aswell as other people, I found no reason to keep trying as it worked as intended and I liked it just as much. The positioning of nav elements in tablet and desktop changed as a spur of the moment decision. And lastly I scrapped the button at the bottom of the home page to navigate to the gallery page, in favour of a sticky top nav.

# Features

Below you will find a list of the features currently found on the site, and also a few features I am planning on adding in the future.

## Existing Features:

### Nav:
* Navigation Bar

    * The navigation bar is fully responsive and uniform across all three pages of the site.

    * The section includes links to the Home, Media and About.

    * Each navigation link has a hover feature providing visual feedback for the user. Each page has a separate active link which provides the user instant feedback regarding their location on the site.



* Sticky Navigation Menu

    * The Sticky Navigation Menu sticks to a fixed position at the top of the screen when a user scrolls below the navigation section.

    * This feature allows users to access any pages of the site without the requirement of scrolling back to the top of the page.

    * The Sticky Navigation Menu takes up very little screen space and therefore doesn't obstruct any of the site's content.

    * This feature is intuitively designed with a recognisable 'burger' style icon and is easily accessible for the user

### Carousel:
    
* The Carousel is fully responsive and is found only on the Home page.

* It allows users to have a preview on the type of images the site is built to showcase

* Rather than a controllable sliding carousel, I went with a automated fade transition as I found it to be more visually appealing aswell as preventing the user rushing through the images.

    * This type of carousel replaced my original idea (found in the wirfeframes section of this Readme). The reason I made the change as it required javascript to run when using the flex function to change the carousel to two and three images depending on screen size. As i have not learned any Js, when talking to my mentor he advised me to try something else as it would be alot of time and effort to get it to work predictably, that would be better spent on other parts of my website.

### Gallery:

### Modal:

### Footer:

* The footer is fully responsive and found on all three pages of the site.

* Whilst content slightly varies on one page, the color scheme and styling remain uniform across all three pages.

* This contains links to the game devs website as well as the witcher fandom page in mobile view on the Home and About pages, for users who wish to learn a lot more about the franchise.

* In tablet and desktop aswell as being present on all screen sizes on the Gallery page, this section also contains a link to an email where users can send any images from the game that they would like to share and have  featured on the site.

## Future Updates:

# Testing

# Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

    * From the left hand menu, select pages.
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch.
    * Once the main branch has been selected, the page will refresh and provide a link to the live project.
